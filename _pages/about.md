<p>
    I am a tenure-track associate professor in 
    <a href="https://www.calstatela.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science at California State University, Los Angeles</a>, 
    interested in teaching and research in computational sciences with applications in drug discovery. 
    I develop machine learning models, scalable optimization algorithms, and high performance computing methods to 
    understand the structure and function of biomolecular systems.
    I was a biomedical research intern at 
    <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/scgpm.html" target="_blank">Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine (SCGPM)</a> 
    in the summer of 2018 and a graduate research assistant at 
    <a href="https://arc.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Virginia Tech Advanced Research Computing (ARC)</a> in 2018â€“2019.
    Currently, I am the PI of an NIH-R16 program at Cal State LA a co-director of the 
    <a href="https://www.calstatela.edu/centers/prec" target="_blank">NSF-PREC program</a> which is a partnership between Cal State LA and <a href="https://molssi.org/" target='_blank'>MolSSI</a>, and an official developer of
    <a href="https://ambermd.org/" target="_blank">AMBER</a>, an open-source software package for molecular dynamics simulation. I also serve as a faculty member of the 
    <a href="https://www.calstatela.edu/ecst/biomedical-engineering" target='_blank'> Biomedical Engineering (BME) Minor Program</a> at Cal State LA.
